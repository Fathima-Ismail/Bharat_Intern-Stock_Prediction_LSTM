# Bharat_Intern-Stock_Prediction_LSTM

This is a repository made for Bharat Intern's first task, in which a machine learning model has to be created to predict stock prices of any company of your choice using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory).

In this Jupyter Notebook code, stock prices of AMAZON have been predicted.

There are two datasets used in this model - AMZNtrain.csv (training dataset) and AMZNtest.csv (test dataset). Both the csv files have been provided in this repository.

However, you can find Amazon's stock prices dataset (which gets updated daily) from kaggle:
